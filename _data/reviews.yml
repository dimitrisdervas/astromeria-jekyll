  review: The view from the balcony is simply breathtaking… just want to sit, drink wine, read and enjoy the view of Souda Bay. The hosts were so sweet, gracious and caring. Apartment was spotless. Simple but everything we needed. Aircon was good. Wifi was excellent. Beautifully cared for courtyards & balconyies with bougainvillia & vines.

  review: The apartment in which we stayed was very clean, warm and airy, just steps from the town center; the view from the balcony was superb, especially at sunset. The owners are courteous and polite and thank you again for your pleasant stay.
