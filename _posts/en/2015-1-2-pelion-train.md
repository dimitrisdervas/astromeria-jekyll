On October 12th, 1895 the steam train of Pelion, “Moutzouris”, made its inaugural journey from Volos to Ano Lechonia (13km). Eight years later, the extension from Ano Lechonia to Milies (15,2km) was opened.

In the late 19th century, Charilaos Trikoupis, the Prime Minister at the time, decided to construct a railway network for Thessalia. The network first connected the port of Volos with Velestino and then Larissa, Farsala, Karditsa, Trikala, and Kalabaka. The railway had a gauge of 1 metre. The contractors decided to expand the network to the east, and so constructed a railway from Volos to the coastal villages of the Pagasitikos Gulf, which at that time had no public transport. The contracts between the company and the state were signed in 1895.

Because of the topography of the region, the constructors decided on a gauge of 60cm. The designer and supervisor of the works was Evaristo De Chirico, the father of the famous surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico. Italian workers and Pelion builders were used to carry out the construction work. The result, even today, is considered amazing, not only in terms of the perfection of the construction, but also with regards to the way the whole construction is integrated into the environment. This railway route is now one of the most famous in the world because of its outstanding beauty.

For the purposes of the railway line, Evaristo De Chirico constructed nine bridges (eight made of stone and one of iron), two tunnels and a significant number of supports. One of the bridges, the iron bridge above the Taxiarhis torrent, now known as “De Chirico Bridge”, is special because of its design. The railway line follows a curve, whereas the bridge itself is straight. Another bridge, the “Vrichonas bridge”, built in 1917, is famous for being the first bridge made of concrete.



As for the train itself, three Hagans steam engines were selected, but they were inadequate for the expansion to Milies, so five more Belgian engines were acquired. Moreover, open and closed carriages as well as cargo carriages were used. In the years that followed, the train provided transport for members of the local community. The contractor were under obligation to repair the old cobbled paths that were used by donkeys carrying construction material, in exchange for free grazing in the local fields. In this way, many of the cobbled paths were constructed/repaired.

During German occupation, the German army used the train for transport. Upon leaving, they deliberately destroyed most of the infrastructure, which was later restored.

As the road network was developed, so the train lost much from its usefulness. The increase of traffic within Volos caused many problems. During the last years of the train, only the first and the last journey each day actually went along Dimitriados Street. On August 1st, 1971, the train finally stopped running …

During the 80’s, there were many attempts to revive the train. During that time, the train made some occasional appearances. In 1994, the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) began restoration works on the railway line as well as on some station buildings. Finally, on May 25th, 1996, the route from Ano Lechonia to Milies was re-established and the train began to run again. Nowadays, the train operates mainly at weekends, offering visitors a chance to enjoy the area by using a method of transport other than the road network.
